         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>SIR, when you laſt entertained me with your good Company, you were extreamly obliging, eſpecially in aſſerting the Doctrines of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be pure and Apoſtolick: and as I endeavoured to confirm you in that good Opinion, I was at the ſame time as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtirouſly concerned, to abate your prejudice againſt ſome of her Ceremonies: and as I have juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admired your even Temper, moderate Spirit and ſound Judgment, therefore cannot but think you will pardon my freedom if for once I commit a Treſpaſs upon your Patience, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to confute your Error, and remove your indigeſted Notions. In our late Conference you appeared much for Union; but you were ſo ſqueaſie and cropſick, that you needed to conſult a Phyſician to clear your Stomach from Phlegm and Choler: I remember you ſeemed much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed at our <hi>Bells</hi> and <hi>Crutches,</hi> which if our Church would ſhake off, we ſhould find you in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſpoſition to imbrace her Communion. Sir, if you cannot digeſt that you call popiſh and profane noiſe of Bells in our Steeples, (ſince you can not but know they were appointed for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end but the Calling the People together to worſhip God) you would do well to think of ſome other Inſtruments: I confeſs I apprehend it more decent than winding the Horn, blowing the Trumpet, or beating the Drum. Sir, my kindneſs for your Perſonal Virtues is exceeding great, and I would gladly imploy my utmoſt thoughts in contributing towards the ſatisfying your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Scruples, had I a Key to unlock your <hi>dark Metaphors:</hi> and whereas you deſire us to ſhake off our <hi>Bells</hi> and lay aſide our <hi>Crutches,</hi> I hope you will firſt prove we wear them. As for the word <hi>Shake,</hi> it is more proper to be uſed to <hi>Quakers;</hi> but ſhaking of Bells I judge moſt applicable to Morrice-Dancers: and ſuch you repreſent us to be by your blind and obſcure Sayings. But before I proceed to diſcourſe further upon this Topick, I muſt unfold your meaning; The Organs in our Churches which ſo highly offend your ſcrupulous Conſciences, and bugbear you out of our Communion, ſufficiently incite us to pity your Underſtandings, and to prevail with you to lay aſide Pride Prejudice, and a peeviſh Spirit. Can you upon Scripture Grounds warrant your departure from us? and why are you hus tranſported with indignation againſt our Church-Diſcipline, when you may be juſtly cenſured amongſt thoſe furious Zealots, who, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> bears Record, had a Zeal, but not according to Knowledge, and ſince from Holy Scripture we have but this general Rule for the Diſcipline of the Church: That <hi>all things be done decently and in order,</hi> you ought to prove her injunctions incongruous to the one, or the other; or to aſſign ſome ſolid Reaſons for ſuch your unchriſtian Clamors: but if the Wiſdom and Experience of our Spiritual Paſtors have thought fit to praiſe God with the Organ, (an Inſtrument proper to raiſe our dull Affections, and, if poſſible, to charm us into the deepeſt contemplations of Love and Adoration of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible Being which was, and is, and ſhall be for ever: 'Tis acknowledged theſe are but faint and imperfect Emblems of that perpetual Harmony we ſhall ere long be heartily ingaged in, when Mortals muſt put on Immortality. But you will object, it is the Heart and not the Voice
<pb facs="tcp:41323:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>that renders this ſervice acceptable to God: as the Heart of a Good man is filled with Secret Love, and warm'd with Internal Devotion; ſo the Voice at that inſtant is an outward manifeſtation of our hearty and exalted Affections to the Supream Goodneſs: and that Organical Sound, ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the Voice, becomes a further Inſtrument of praiſe by helping our bodily Infirmities, chearing our Spirits, quickning our Affections to a rejoycing in future Heavenly Hope. As for thoſe Excellent <hi>Forms of Prayer,</hi> you term <hi>Crutches,</hi> compoſed by thoſe Holy men, who ſealed them with their Blood, (and thereby gave ample teſtimony they were illuminated by the Spirit of God) the Church hath thought fit to retain at this day: and the Excellency and Uſefulneſs of thoſe <hi>Prayers</hi> you have recommended to you by the learned Doctor <hi>Beveridge:</hi> and <hi>God be praiſed,</hi> ſuch is the Chriſtian Modeſty and profound Humility of the Pious part of our Church, that they are not aſhamed to own themſelves Spiritually lame, blind, and naked; attended with a numerous train of bodily Imperfections, <hi>crippled</hi> in their Memories, and darkend in their Intellects, and <hi>therefore</hi> they come not with <hi>God I thank thee</hi> but, God <hi>be merciful to me.</hi> Daily experience hath convinc'd them, how often they are nonpluſt in the preſence of Earthly Majeſty; and from thence they are fully inſtructed in their duty to God, to offer up ſuch prayers as contain a Catalogue of their wants, and expreſs an humble ſenſe of the vaſt diſtance and diſproportion betwixt God and his Creatures: they endeavour to avoid indecent and ſaucy Expreſſions, licentious Rambles, vain Repetitions, and bold and ſamiliar Talk with Almighty God, which muſt either leſſen Attention, or at leſt creat levity in the Hearer. Hence it is ſuch numbers of looſe People flock to Doctor <hi>Burges</hi>'s Meeting, declaring they find more diverſion in his Comical Diſcourſe, then in a Play; and although, I think, theſe people ſpend their time but ill, yet I can not but obſerve, were there not a <hi>Merry Andrew,</hi> there would be no <hi>Spectators:</hi> and although we allow he may be an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of doing ſome good to the meaner Capacities; yet, as ſome, learned diſſenting Divines have wiſely obſerved by his indiſcreet Behaviour, he doth as much harm: And if he were diſmiſt the Pulpit till he has learnt to behave himſelf more reverently in it; he could no longer ſerve the ends of Atheiſts and Papiſts, who ſo readily take advantage to ridicule the Reformation; and common Obſervation hath convinced me, that ſuch whoſe pride and fancy have advanc'd them above the uſe of Forms, too often, in their <hi>extempore</hi> prayers, trump up ſuch fulſome loſe or imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent babblings as are not allowable in ſober Converſation. How then ſhall the Judicious be able to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to their Prayers. When I pray by a Set Form, my great Duty is to get my Heart to aſſent to the Words. I am before fully ſatisfied they contain hearty Confeſſions, humble Petitions, and thankful Acknowledgments, and in words proper and ſignificant, fitted even to the loweſt capacity. And I have altogether as much reaſon to believe, the Spirit of God will be aiding my Infirmities in theſe plain and eaſie forms of Prayer, as in the moſt flouriſhing <hi>extempore</hi> Addreſſes. And has not our bleſſed Lord (the Wiſdom of the Father Saviour, of the World) recommended to our choice and uſe, the moſt perfect and exact form of Prayer: for was it not ſaid, writ, and injoined our imitation, and yet ſo impiouſly ignorant, ſo fanatically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited are many amongſt us at this day, eſpecially of the Independant and Baptiſt or plunging Party that ſhould their Teachers repeat the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> they would immediately expreſs their reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in a ſour and angry Aſpect, ye, and perhaps reproach him as a formal lukewarm Fellow, a Shepherd unfit to inſtruct a knowing Congregation. As for the Liturgy and Collects of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I ſee no juſt exceptions againſt them, and ſince forms of Prayer were conſtantly uſed by the Primitive Fathers, and were highly eſteemed by our firſt Reformers from Popery, and are now retained in moſt of the reformed Churches in <hi>Europe.</hi> What reaſon then have we to deſpiſe a form of ſound words framed by men who gave ſuch convincing evidences to the World, by their Zeal for God's Glory, and their conſtant perſeverance in the true Religion, that they were Strangers and Pilgrims upon Earth, and being abundantly influenc'd by the Holy Spirit: they went on their way rejoycing to Heaven, Praiſing and Glorifying God, who had accounted them worthy to be witneſſes to the Truth of the Goſpel, and in imitation of the Bleſſed <hi>JESUS</hi> the Author and Finiſher of their Faith, they deſpiſed their Lives, imbraced the Flames, and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly placed at the Right-hand of God, poſſeſſing an inheritance incorruptable and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.</p>
